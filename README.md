This is my first project in C#

It has allowed me to work with some basics and to take my learning a bit further. Things such as:

- Properties
- Methods
- Arguments- Lists
- Getter and setters
- static vs non-static

- OOP
  - Classes
  - 'Is A' & 'Has A' / Inheritance & composition
  - polymorphism
  - abstract
  - virtual
  - override
